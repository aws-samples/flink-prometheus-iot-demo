# Apache Flink Prometheus Connector demo - Vehicle IoT

This repository contains an end-to-end demo using [Apache Flink Prometheus connector](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-prometheus).

The demo simulates a vehicle IoT use case.

This is designed to run with [Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-service-apache-flink/),
[Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) 
and [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/), but it can be easily adapted to 
any other Apache Flink, Apache Kafka and Prometheus versions.
